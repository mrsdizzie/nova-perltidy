# Perltidy for Nova

This extension provides integration with the [Perltidy](https://perltidy.sourceforge.net) formatter for the Nova text editor.

## Requirements

The only requirement is Perltidy itself, which can be installed from the [official website](https://perltidy.sourceforge.net), CPAN, or Homebrew:

```shell
$ brew install perltidy
```

### Configuration

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select perltidy's **Preferences** tab. Note that this extension relies on parsing `STDOUT` and `STDERR` from Perltidy. If you include options to suppress those it will not work as expected.

## Usage

To run Perltidy:

- Open the command palette and type `perltidy`
- Select `perltidy` from the Editor menu

Perltidy will then format and replace the text in your current editor with a "tidy" version based on your configuration. If a block of text is selected, it will only format the selected text.

## Errors

This extension will not apply any changes if Perltidy returns an error code. Perltidy does provide specific error output when code is not valid Perl, but it is _not_ a linter. This extension attempts to capture and parse the Perltidy error output and convert it into issues within Nova:

This approach may yield mixed results; for example, a missing closing quote on line 30 might not manifest as a Perltidy error until the next quote appears on line 200. Depending on the problem, the errors may seem random and unrelated to the initial cause.
